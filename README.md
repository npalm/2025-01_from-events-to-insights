# Talk - From Events to Insights: Harnessing the Power of Event-Driven

Events are everywhere! In this talk, we'll explore how to harness the power of event-driven architectures on AWS to build more dynamic and intelligent applications. We'll dive deep into AWS EventBridge and demonstrate how to capture, process, and act on events at scale.

Through a real-world example using GitHub events, we'll show you how to dynamically scale self-hosted action runners, trigger automated processes, and build a data lake to capture a comprehensive view of events within your system. This allows you to analyze patterns and gain a deeper understanding of what's happening across your entire environment.

We'll share lessons learned from building and scaling this architecture, including the challenges we encountered, the solutions we developed, and the key takeaways for your own event-driven journey. Join us and discover how to achieve greater efficiency, scalability, and insight with an event-driven approach.
